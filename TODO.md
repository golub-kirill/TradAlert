> ## ★ NORTH STAR #2 (2026-06-04): UNIVERSE-AGNOSTIC — don't tune to the watchlist.
> The watchlist is an input that **changes** (could be a handful or hundreds). Logic and
> parameters must hold across **any size/composition** — never overfit to the current
> ~91 names or their count. Prefer **relative/percentile/adaptive** knobs over absolute
> counts (watch `portfolio.max_concurrent`, breadth-by-fixed-count, etc.).

## ▶ DO / VERIFY FIRST — cleanup & patches (small, low-risk, high-leverage)

Order: things that distort the *metrics we decide on* → universe-agnostic fixes
(NORTH STAR #2) → hygiene. Run/clear these before the bigger bets.

**Metric-correctness (we quote these numbers — fix first):**
- ✅ **Sharpe/Sortino methodology — FIXED 2026-06-04** (`stats_utils`). Now **rf=0,
  scale-invariant** Sharpe (dropped the hardcoded "1R ≈ 10%" cash-rate conversion that
  conflicted with the 1%-fixed-risk policy); Sortino downside deviation now uses the
  **textbook /N** form (was /down-month-count). Conventions pinned by `test_core_math.py`
  (199 passed). **Figures partly refreshed:** the 25d-hard headline was re-journaled
  under rf=0 (`run_id=6`, 2026-06-04 → **Sharpe 0.58, Sortino 1.02**, +87.5R, 1211t).
  Remaining configs (OFF baseline, `if_not_profit`, 10–30d sweep, deflated Sharpe) in
  ADR-001/verification still predate the fix; relative comparisons unaffected
  (monotonic transform).
- ✅ **`Trade.compute_r` 0R on gap-through entry — DOCUMENTED & CLOSED 2026-06-04.**
  7 of ~1098 trades gap through; the same-bar stop fills exit ≈ entry, so the loss is
  slippage-only (~**−0.25R** total — ~1% of the headline's ±~26R bootstrap SE, i.e.
  immaterial). Not a hidden left-tail. Documented as by-design in `compute_r`'s
  docstring; the `intended_risk` plumbing (4 files) isn't worth 0.25R.

**Universe-agnostic (NORTH STAR #2):**
- ✅ **`compute_sp500_breadth` full-universe — FIXED 2026-06-04** (`breadth.py`).
  Dropped the `constituents[:100]` truncation (was using ~100 of **503** S&P names,
  alphabetical A–C bias); now iterates the full universe with a vectorised row-wise
  mean (warmup/missing-date semantics preserved). Smoke-tested: 6887 rows 1999–2026,
  recent ~59% above MA200.
- ◻ **`portfolio.max_concurrent: 6`** is a fixed cap tuned to ~91 names — wrong for a
  tiny list, a bottleneck for a huge one. Make it relative (e.g. % of universe / risk
  budget) or document the assumption.

**Hygiene / reproducibility:**
- ✅ **`data/backtest_schema.sql` — CREATED 2026-06-04** (was missing; elevated now
  that journaling is default-on so fresh deploys can journal).
- ◻ **Inline magic-number fallbacks → `defaults.py`**: `gap_risk` 3.0
  (`filter_engine.py:535`), `max_bars_since_cross` 3 (`:933/982`), dv20 window 20,
  `_score_rs_exit` ×10, `_score_bb_zscore` /2.0 (`scoring`). They read config but the
  fallback default is inline — centralise.
- ◻ **`json_cache.save_section` RMW not lock-safe** — safe today (single writer); add a
  file lock or document the single-writer assumption.
- ◻ **Dual earnings cache** — `earnings_history.py` (`data/fundamentals/`) vs
  `earnings_history_store.py` (`data/earnings_history/`); two staleness clocks can
  drift. Consolidate.
- ◻ **VBP not canonical** — `compute_vbp` bins `close × volume` in the close bin, not
  the H-L spread (`scanner.vbp.*` is wired, the algorithm isn't). Rewrite or rename.

**Verified DONE this session (do NOT re-do):** ✅ `DEFAULT_SCALE` + `run_backtest`
print-fallback synced to `{2:0.5,3:0.25}` (`ticker_health.py:59`); ✅ sweep dead-key
`size_mult_floor`; ✅ report-coloring convention; ✅ max-hold `time_stop` exit.

## ★ ACTIVE — win now (NORTH STAR #1)

- ◻ **Run `main.py` DAILY (schedule it).** The live-reconciliation feed is the only
  way to judge "winning now", and it's just ~1 week / 62 signals old. Windows Task
  Scheduler → `main.py` after the US close; signals mature in ~25 trading days.
- ◻ **Live-vs-backtest reconciliation — BUILT, but limited.** `scripts/reconcile_live.py`
  + `scan_results` enrichment (`stop_price`/`target_price`/`signal_type` via
  `data/scan_results_recon_migration.sql` + `db.py`). **Honest caveat (2026-06-04):**
  replaying live-fired signals through cached prices ≈ a *delayed backtest* — it only
  checks signal-generation fidelity. The version that isn't a backtest reconciles
  **actual fills** (`positions`, currently empty) vs the model. **Next:** when real /
  paper trades are logged via `position_CLI`, repoint reconcile at closed `positions`
  (realized fills vs expectancy) — that's the true win-now meter.
- ✅ **Max-hold exit — headline = 25-bar hard** (`ADR-001`). Real but thin edge
  (deflated Sharpe ~0.44; survivorship discount ~11–22%, honest universe still
  positive). Optional/secondary: V5 walk-forward+robustness OOS gate; set
  `execution.max_hold_days: 25` as default after live performance is confirmed.

## Raw-notes triage (2026-06-03) — mostly resolved

Detail + file:line evidence: `docs/triage_raw_notes_2026-06.md`.
- ✅ Note 1 — max-hold exit / artificial WR → fixed (see ACTIVE above, `ADR-001`).
- ✅ Note 2 — sweep dead-key fixed; breadth-divergence penalty is *wired-but-dormant*.
- ✅ Note 3 — report coloring convention applied.
- ✅ Note 4 — consecutive-loss guard already exists (`TickerHealth`); scale de-fanged
  to `{2:0.5,3:0.25}`; A/B shows a tiny net-positive variance effect.
- ◻ (secondary) Instrument how often the momentum-fade RSI floor / breadth-divergence
  flag actually *bind* — to decide prune/keep. Cheap, not urgent.

---

## Secondary / paused — validation & de-biasing (per NORTH STAR #1)

Design: `docs/validation_program_design.md` (note: file currently deleted in tree —
restore or drop the reference). Edge after de-biasing is real-but-thin; deep rigor
is paused until live performance is healthy.
- ✅ **Phase A — survivorship** (A0 symbology; A1 frozen-universe A/B run 2026-06-04 →
  selection discount ~11–22%, honest universe stays positive). Gate closed.
- ◻ **Phase B — realistic frictions**: costs/slippage/borrow ON by default + sweep
  (slippage bites hard: 0→+117.5R, 0.002→+65.7R).
- ◻ **Phase C — locked OOS**: tune ≤2015, lock, test 2016-2026 once.
- ◻ **Phase D — multiple-testing correction**: deflated Sharpe / White reality check.
- ◻ **Phase E — live reconciliation**: the ACTIVE item above (paper-trade + reconcile).
- ◻ V5 walk-forward + robustness on 25d-hard (OOS gate for the headline).

---

## Deferred — bigger work, not now

**Scoring** (`scoring.py`, `defaults.py`, `settings.yaml`)
- ◻ Sub-score audit: `_score_rs_entry/_exit` sanity under `direction == "short"`.
- ◻ Keep `ConfigError` guard: `scanner.weights.insider_buying`/`short_interest` stay 0
  until Form 4 XML + live short-interest validated.

**Backtester fills** (verify in PyCharm)
- ◻ Open-EOD count regression; slippage stress test across `entry_slippage_pct ∈
  {0,0.002,0.003}`.

**Behavioral / macro fetchers**
- ◻ Form 4 XML parser (direct SEC EDGAR, P vs S; needs `SEC_USER_AGENT`).
- ◻ Survivorship in `sp500_constituents`/`tsx60` (date-stamped membership = Phase A
  for tier_b).
- ◻ FOMC/CPI live scrape (calendar.py ships a hard-coded 2026 list).
- ◻ Verify AAII/NAAIM/COT parses still match live pages (layout-drift risk).

**Reporting / observability**
- ✅ **Signal screenshots date-stamped 2026-06-04** — `data/screenshots/{TICKER}_{Dmonyy}.webp`
  using the signal bar's date (e.g. `URA_4jun26.webp`); daily shots no longer overwrite
  (`chart.py`).
- ◻ Stand-down log (silent-regime months block); per-direction breakdown in report.
- ◻ Telegram alerts (`TG_CHAT_ID`/`TG_BOT_TOKEN` reserved, unwired).

**Watchlist expansion** (mind NORTH STAR #2 — don't tune to it)
- ◻ ~15 more `.TO` ETFs into tier_a; ≤20% individual stocks; >5y history.

**Architecture / performance** (defer)
- ◻ Split FilterEngine god-class / main.py / sweep.py; `ApplicationContext` DI;
  `max_concurrent_per_sector` via `sector_map.yaml`.
- ◻ `_pack_universe` → `shared_memory`; walk-forward sweep cache key incl. grid hash.

**Operational**
- ◻ `position_CLI.py open --date YYYY-MM-DD` (retroactive opens — needed to backfill
  `positions` for the real reconciliation). Pin `requirements.txt` for release.

## Standing rules

- `pytest tests/` green at the end of every step (192 + max-hold/ticker = **197**).
- README sync after any landed change (CLI flags, config blocks, test counts, entry
  points). Fresh clone + `pip install -r requirements.txt` + README should run.
- **JOURNALING POLICY (2026-06-04): every run leaves data.** `run_backtest.py` journals
  by default (`--no-journal` for throwaway); `main.py` auto-journals + warns loudly if
  the DB is down. `reconcile_live.py` uses the latest backtest run as reference and
  prints which one (`--bt-run-id N` to override). Exploratory harnesses
  (compare/ab/frozen) do NOT journal.
